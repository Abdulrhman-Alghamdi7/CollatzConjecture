# CollatzConjecture

The Collatz Conjecture is a mathematical sequence defined by the following rule: Start with any positive integer n. If n is even, divide it by 2; if it is odd, multiply it by 3 and add 1. Repeat the process with the resulting number. The conjecture suggests that, regardless of the initial value chosen, the sequence will eventually reach the cycle 4-2-1 and continue indefinitely.

when I read about it I want to make a program to see how its work in lists of number and big numbers. 
The code ask for an integar that is the last number in the range, then the code apply Collatz Conjecture in every number in the range and calculate the biggest number in every process and the count of steps and represents it graphically x axis is the number, y axis is the biggest number in the process.
